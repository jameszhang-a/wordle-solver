# Wordle Solver

## How to use
1. Enter each right guess in the first grid

2. Enter all letters that you know aren't in a certain position in the second grid

3. For all yellow letters (ones that are in the word, but in the wrong places) put in the third input

4. For all gray letters (ones that aren't in the word at all) put in the last input

## Some tips
- If you get a yellow letter, put it in both the third input, **and** exclude it  in the second grid
